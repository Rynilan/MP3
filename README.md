A simple interface to play .mp3 (and .wav) files.
It isn't in its "final form" as some features will be added on the future, but, I am to excited to share it.
Some features that 'll come:
* english support (and some other languages), for now it only supports portuguese.
* Bug fixes, there is some bugs on the code, this is a "alpha" version of it.
* Visual feedback for errors.
* Some others cool stuff.
Dependencies: time, os, pydub, threading, tkinter, pathlib, random, pydub and wave
