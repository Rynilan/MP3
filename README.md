# Overview

A simple interface to play .mp3 files.  
It isn't in its "final form" as some features will be added on the future,  
but, I am to excited to share it.

# Coming

* Visual feedback for errors.
* Support for spanish, french and german.
* Sound feedback to interactions.
* Fully functional pause, next 10s and previous 10s buttons.
* Some others cool stuff.
Dependencies: time, os, pygame, threading, tkinter and random

# How to run

Simplily clone/download this repository and run the 'Principal.py' file:  
<code> python Principal.py; </code>
